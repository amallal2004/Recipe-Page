## Lessons Learned

During the project, I started by creating a Figma design based on the JPG reference file provided in the challenge. This allowed me to analyze the layout and design details before beginning development.

While working on this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML tags
- Using CSS to create responsive designs with BEM naming convention
- Managing font sizes, paddings, and margins to match a design closely
- Optimizing images for performance
- Implementing BEM methodology for maintainable and scalable CSS
